            <h1>Club History</h1>
            <p>Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7-1.<br>The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players - the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors.<br> Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland - so they became known as the "team of Macs".<br><strong>The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893-94 season.</strong> <br><i>After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager</i> .<br> He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.</p><hr>
